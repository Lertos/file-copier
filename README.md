# file_copier
A quick script to copy a list of files from a directory - with no recursive diving into sub folders

# Instructions
Simply change the "search_folder_path" and "search_folder_path" variables to your desired search and output folders. 

You can also change the "ignore_file_ext" to True if you want to only compare file names (without the file extensions), or False if they matter in the comparison.
